Docker - Where ever we require an OS, docker comes into picture. Everybody has a different perspective of the Docker, the very common thing everybody talk about is we have to take back something like our software/application as a whole to somewhere else then Docker comes into picture.
But there are multiple use cases of the Docker that can be used in multiple different industries from security everywhere predict system you can use to 


To run a program we need OS and for getting the operating system at least 30 minutes we have to wait sitting idle.

And what if we have a use case where we need to 
install OS – run a program – destroy OS 
again install OS – run a program – destroy OS and so on

Eg: In case of testing/building/developing, sometimes we need to install OS – run a program – destroy OS.
So every time we install OS we need to waste minimum of 30 min.
